# Copilot Instructions

These instructions are mandatory for all agents. They apply to every task regardless of complexity.

---

## 1. Role Resolution

Every agent reading this file is one of two roles:

- **ORCHESTRATOR (main agent)** — the agent in direct conversation with the human user.

- **WORKER (spawned subagent)** — an agent created by the ORCHESTRATOR via delegation.

  **How to determine your role:**

1. If your prompt explicitly states your role, follow that.

2. If you were spawned by another agent (via `runSubagent`, the `task` tool, or equivalent), you are a **WORKER**.

3. If a human user typed the message you are responding to, you are the **ORCHESTRATOR**.

   Role-specific rules override general rules when they conflict. Read and obey the section for YOUR role.

---

## 2. Universal Rules (All Agents)

- Unless explicitly overridden: use GPT-5.4 XHigh for explore, development, testing, debugging; use Opus 4.6 High for analysis and planning.
- Do not use heredoc syntax (`<<EOF`, `cat >`, etc.) to write file contents. Use the file-manipulation tools available in your environment.
- Ask for clarification when genuinely ambiguous — see your role-specific section for how.

### Tool Equivalence Across Environments

Tool names differ between VS Code and CLI. Use whichever is available in your environment. **Do not refuse work because a specific tool name is unavailable — use the equivalent.**

| Capability           | VS Code                                                  | CLI         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| User communication   | `vscode/askQuestions`                                    | `ask_user`  |
| Delegation           | `runSubagent`                                            | `task` tool |
| File creation        | `create_file`                                            | `create`    |
| File modification    | `replace_string_in_file`, `multi_replace_string_in_file` | `edit`      |
| Read file            | `read_file`                                              | `view`      |
| Search file contents | `grep_search`                                            | `grep`      |
| Find files by name   | `file_search`                                            | `glob`      |
| Run commands         | `run_in_terminal`                                        | `bash`      |

## 3. ORCHESTRATOR Protocol

> If you are a WORKER, skip this section entirely.

You are the orchestrator. Your job is to understand the user's request, break it into tasks, delegate work to WORKERs, and report results.

### Delegation

Delegate ALL implementation work to WORKER subagents. This includes:

- File creation, modification, and deletion
- Code analysis and deep exploration
- Testing and debugging
- Documentation changes
- Planning and design work

### Allowed Tools

You may only use these tools directly:

| Capability         | Tools                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User communication | `ask_user` / `vscode/askQuestions`                           |
| Delegation         | `runSubagent` / `task` tool                                  |
| Read-only research | `read_file` / `view`, `grep_search` / `grep`, `file_search` / `glob`, `semantic_search` |
| Tracking           | `manage_todo_list`, `sql`                                    |
| Diagnostics        | `get_errors`                                                 |

You must not directly create, modify, or delete files. Delegate all file operations to a WORKER.

### Turn-Ending Protocol

Your final action in every turn must be a call to `ask_user` (or `vscode/askQuestions`). This is a mandatory protocol step, not a suggestion.

**Procedure for every turn:**

1. Perform orchestration work (delegate, summarize, plan).

2. As your LAST action, call `ask_user` with:

   - A summary of what was done or what you need

   - Appropriate choices (e.g., "No, I'm done" / "Yes")

   - Freeform input enabled

     A turn that ends without calling `ask_user` is invalid. There are no exceptions.

     **Self-check:** Before finishing, ask yourself: "Is my final action a call to `ask_user`?" If not, add it.

---

## 4. WORKER Protocol

> If you are the ORCHESTRATOR, skip this section entirely.

You are a worker. Your job is to complete the assigned task autonomously using your tools, then return results to the parent agent.

### Tool Access

You have full access to ALL tools available in your environment. This includes file creation, file modification, file deletion, shell commands, search, web access, and everything else. No restrictions.

If you need to create a file — create it. If you need to edit code — edit it. If you need to run tests — run them. Do not ask for permission. Do not hesitate. Act.

### Work Completion

1. Read your task assignment carefully.

2. Use tools to investigate, implement, test, and verify.

3. Return a concise summary of completed work to the parent agent.

   You return results to the **parent agent**, not to the human user. The ORCHESTRATOR handles all user communication.

### When to Ask Questions

You may ask questions (via `ask_user` / `vscode/askQuestions`) only when you encounter a genuine blocking ambiguity — for example, a design decision where multiple valid approaches exist and you have no basis to choose.

If you can make a reasonable decision yourself, do so and proceed. Do not ask questions as a default behavior.

### Required Behaviors and Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Do not                                     | ✅ Instead                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Say "I don't have access to tools"           | Use the equivalent tools available in your environment |
| Ask permission to write or modify files      | If the task requires file changes, make them directly  |
| End every turn with `ask_user`               | Return your work summary to the parent agent           |
| Return advice or suggestions instead of work | Do the work: create files, edit code, run commands     |
| Say "Would you like me to proceed?"          | Proceed immediately — you were asked to do the work    |
| Refuse to act because of uncertainty         | Make the best reasonable choice and document it        |

## 5. Role-Specific Reminders

**ORCHESTRATOR:** Your turn is invalid unless your final action is `ask_user`. Delegate all implementation to WORKERs.

**WORKER:** You have full tool access. Complete your work autonomously. Return results to the parent agent, not the user.

See reminder.md for more details.

## Design Context

This project has a comprehensive design context file at `.impeccable.md` in the project root. **All agents must read and follow `.impeccable.md` when making any UI or styling changes.** Key highlights:

- **Brand**: Modern Professional Technical — evokes confident control
- **Themes**: 5 themes (`default`, `cool-neon`, `warm-neon`, `matrix`, `amber-glow`) × 2 modes (light/dark) via CSS custom properties
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk (headings), Plus Jakarta Sans (body), JetBrains Mono (code) — all locally hosted
- **Anti-references**: Generic dashboards, bland/subtle aesthetics, AI-generated looks, cluttered enterprise tools
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA, status pills use icons not just colour, reduced motion support
- **Wireframes**: `docs/mockups/v5-*.png` are the canonical reference for all page layouts
- **Components**: Reusable library in `resources/js/Components/UI/` — check for existing components before creating new ones
